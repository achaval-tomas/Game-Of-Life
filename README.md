# Game-Of-Life

Another one of my first few projects in C++, lots of improvements to be done.

My version of Conway's well-known Game of Life made in C++ and SDL.

Keybinds:
Left click to add living cells, right click to remove them. Space to start/pause and C to clear the screen and reset generations.
